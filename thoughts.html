        <p>I first watched EVA when I was a middle school student. At that time adolescence I saw the same teenage
            protagonists confusion and growth is very much the same feeling.</p>
        <p>I grew up, but eva's new work was difficult to produce for various reasons. Last year, the last one was
            finally released, and I couldn't help but cry when I saw the people in the show reconciled with themselves
            and returned to real life.</p>
        <p>This is my favorite scene from the Final. Shinji is back to real life with Mari.</p>

        <p>They are reconciled to themselves and are completed.</p>

        <p>I have grown up. Goodbye, my youth. Goodbye, all the Evangelions.</p>
