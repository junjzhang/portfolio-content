        <p>This is the cast of Evangelion.</p>
        <img src="images/cast.jpg" alt="Cast" />
        <p>My favorite character. The Second Child and Pilot of Evangelion Unit-02. Nerv's highly trained pilot ace, she
            is none too pleased at
            being upstaged by Shinji, but is still drawn to him despite herself. Her independent and hot-tempered
            personality masks some old and painful wounds. Her rebuild counterpart Asuka Shikinami Langley is treated as
            a separate character below. While adapted from Asuka Langley Soryu of the original series, her Japanese
            surname is different, and her characterization diverges in highly significant ways over the course of the
            New Theatrical Edition movies.</p>
        <img src="images/asuka-langley-soryu.jpg" alt="Asuka Langley Soryu" />
        <p>The central protagonist of Evangelion, and the main pilot of Evangelion Unit-01. Defeating the Angel's and
            saving the world are the least of Shinji's worries as he struggles to overcome his own inner demons.</p>

        <p>Vice Commander of Nerv and Gendo's right hand. Fuyutsuki was formerly a professor of metaphysical biology,
            and was part of the UN investigation into Second Impact. Though he once tried to reveal the truth to the
            world, he now works alongside Gendo as the two work tow</p>
        <img src="images/kozo-fuyutsuki.jpg" alt="Kozo Fuyutsuki" />
        <p>Commander of Nerv and Shinji's estranged father. Gendo Ikari has been given extra-legal authority by the UN
            to defeat the Angels by any means neccessary; and he has yet more powerful benefactors with their own,
            darker goals in mind. But it is his own, personal goal of reuniting with Yui which he will stop at nothing
            to achieve.</p>
        <img src="images/gendo-ikari.jpg" alt="Gendo Ikari" />
        <p>The Fifth Child... and the Final Angel. Kaworu is sent to Tokyo-3 by Seele to foil Commander Ikari's plans,
            but along the way takes more than a passing interest in Shinji. The Angel of Free Will, he chooses to make
            the ultimate expression of his idiom.</p>
        <img src="images/kaworu-nagisa.jpg" alt="Kaworu Nagisa" />
        <p>Unrivaled Otaku of Class 2-A's and Shinji's friend. Kensuke is Evangelion—mad, and always seems to know more
            than he really should.</p>
        <img src="images/kensuke-aida.jpg" alt="Kensuke Aida" />
        <p>The enigmatic pilot of Evangelion Unit-05.</p>
        <img src="images/mari-makinami-illustrious.jpg" alt="Mari Makinami" />
        <p>Nerv's Chief of Tactical Operations and Shinji's self appointed guardian. Misato weighs her private concerns
            against her professional duty as she works to defeat the Angels and discover the secrets behind Second
            Impact
            and Tokyo-3.</p>
        <img src="images/misato-katsuragi.jpg" alt="Misato Katsuragi" />
        <p>The First Child and Pilot of Evangelion Unit-00. Rei's quiet speech and ethereal appearance belie her greater
            nature, and purpose. Her connections to Shinji, Unit-01, and Commander Ikari are deeper and darker than they
            seem.</p>
        <img src="images/rei-ayanami.jpg" alt="Rei Ayanami" />
        <p>The Head of Project E and Nerv's chief scientist, Dr Akagi employs the world's most advanced technology to
            keep the Evangelions' enormous power restrained; barely. Ritsuko is Misato's oldest and closest friend, but
            she is deeper in the Commander's confidences—and more besides.</p>
        <img src="images/ritsuko-akagi.jpg" alt="Ritsuko Akagi" />
        <p>Tokyo-3's most dashing triple agent, and an old flame of Misato. Kaji runs a dangerous game of lies, playing
            Nerv, Seele and the Japanese Intelligence Ministry against each other; and all while trying to discover the
            real truth for himself.</p>
        <img src="images/ryoji-kaji.jpg" alt="Ryoji Kaji" />
        <p>Class 2-A's resident jock and Shinji's close friend—after a rocky start. But underneath Toji's tough exterior
            lies a heart of gold.</p>
        <img src="images/toji-suzuhara.jpg" alt="Toji Suzuhara" />
        <p>Shinji's mother and Commander Ikari's lost wife. Yui's body is lost to this world, but she lives on inside
            the core of EVA-01.</p>
